# Switch your TV on via IR remote control.
#
# To make this script work, you need to:
#
# 1. Get a IR transmitter for your computer. If you can't find one that connects
#    directly to your computer, you can make one for yourself using a cheap IR
#    transmitter module and a USB-to-GPIO breakout board e.g. Adafruit MCP2221A.
#
#    Note: plain IR LEDs need resistors to work properly and should not be
#    connected directly to GPIO. You can find mini IR modules online that have
#    this all included, that can be connected directly to GPIO.
#
#    (Other options are possible e.g. Arduino, RPi, but the breakout board as we
#    suggest is the least complex, runs the fastest, and uses the fewest wires.)
#
# 2. Install and configure LIRC to correctly talk to your IR transmitter, as well
#    as having knowledge of the codes for your IR remote control.
#
#    a. You can possibly get the codes online on LIRC's website, or if not then:
#    b. You'll have to detect them yourself. This is not that hard:
#
#       1. Get a IR receiver for your computer similar to step (1).
#       2. Configure LIRC to correctly talk to your IR receiver.
#       3. Use `irrecord` and follow its instructions to generate a config for
#          your remote. You don't need to configure all the keys but for our
#          scripts here you need at least the power key and a do-nothing key.
#
# 3. Fill in my_remote below, and copy this file without the .example suffix.

my_remote=???
# Rough overestimate of how long it takes for the TV to switch on from being
# hard-off. If this is set too low then cec-autostart may switch the TV on,
# off, on before HDMI-CEC comes online and it can confirm the TV is really on.
