# Switch your TV on whenever your computer wakes up.
#
# Note: this doesn't work out-of-the-box on most hardware. You probably need
# a specially constructed DisplayPort-HDMI adapter, e.g. P/N 2JA63AA from HP.
# Connect the DP end to the DP port on your GPU, then use a normal HDMI cable
# to connect the HDMI end to your TV. Don't use the HDMI port on your GPU.
#
# See https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HDMI-CEC#Hardware_setup
# and https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/media/cec.html#displayport-to-hdmi-adapters-with-working-cec
# for details.
#
# Tested by author with P/N 2JA63AA, Radeon RX 7800 XT GPU, and HiSense TV.

Failed to detect a TV after 10 seconds. If everything was working before, for
example immediately after putting the TV on standby, it's possible that now
your TV is in a hard power-off state where even HDMI-CEC is off. In this case,
it's impossible for anything to control the TV - you'll have to switch it on
manually the normal way. You can also try reporting this to the manufacturer,
and ask them to keep HDMI-CEC on even in the hard power-off state.

You can also try adding a hard-on script to ~/.config/cec-autostart/hard-on
for example, that switches your TV on using an IR transmitter attached to your
computer, via "irsend" from the "lirc" package.
